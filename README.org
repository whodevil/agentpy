#+title: AI Agent

I was watching a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogQUlS7CkYA][youtube video]] on building AI agents,
and this is what following the video looks like as a starting point.

* Technology

- [[https://www.browserless.io/][browserless]] for website scraping
- [[https://openai.com/][Chat GPT]]
- [[https://render.com][render]] for deployment

* Running
#+begin_src sh
pipenv shell
streamlit run agent.py
