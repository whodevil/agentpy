#+title: AI Agent

I was watching a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogQUlS7CkYA][youtube video]] on building AI agents,
and this is what following the video looks like as a starting point.

* Technology
- [[https://streamlit.io/][streamlit]] for UI
- [[https://serper.dev/][serper]] for search
- [[https://www.browserless.io/][browserless]] for website scraping
- [[https://openai.com/][Chat GPT]]
- [[https://render.com][render]] for deployment
- [[https://www.langchain.com/][LangChain]] core logic library driving the agent

* Project Setup
Make a copy of ~example.env~ to ~.env~ in the root of the project, and update the values with the appropriate values.

** API Keys
This project relies on API keys from the following services.
- [[https://serper.dev/][serper]]
- [[https://www.browserless.io/][browserless]]
- [[https://openai.com/][Chat GPT]]

** Running
Note: when running the first time, streamlit will ask for an email address. This is optional, just hit enter.
#+begin_src sh
pipenv install
pipenv shell
streamlit run agent.py
#+end_src

* Enabling Auth
Create a file named auth.yaml in the root of the project and follow the instructions on
[[https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator][the streamlit auth page]]
